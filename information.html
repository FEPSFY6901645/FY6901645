            Abstract: Black holes, formed by the collapse of massive stars, possess an effect on space time that stops even light from escaping it. Light passing it undergoes many phenomena such as, gravitational lensing, red/blue shift, time dilation and much more. These interactions between black holes and light provide insight to physicists about how black holes affect the space around them and their properties such as mass. The purpose of this study is to analyse what exactly happens when light interacts with black holes and how that affects time and light itself.

            To first understand this, you must understand that around a black hole the space time manifold warps due to a black hole's immense gravitational power. To properly understand this, visualize space as a trampoline - if a heavier object is on it, it sinks further in. This has been proven by using gravitational lensing which observes light warping effect around a heavy object in space. The amount of warping gives us insights into how heavy the object is and about dark matter which is not visible but still causes warping in space time. This is the basis to black holes’ effect on time.

            <p style="color:white">Light in its own perspective is not changing at all. However, to an observer many changes may occur if they are in motion or viewing something in motion.
Due to time dilation, light entering a black hole will, from an outsider’s perspective, appear to be entering at a slower speed due to relative movement – the relative velocity between light and observer affects the simultaneity of the occurrence. For example, as a train is moving to the right, Observer A who resides inside the train is equidistant between two lights which flash simultaneously. Observer B, who resides outside the train, sees the flash on the right side of the train first, indicating to Observer B that the light on the right side is moving faster than the light on the left side. This is because, in relation to Observer B, light has a shorter distance to travel since Observer A is in the train which is moving in the direction of that light. Therefore, when on a larger scale with greater distance, it takes longer, hence why there seems to be a time interval between the arrival of each flash. In contrast, Observer A sees both left and right lights flash at the same time due to their distance from her being equal in her reference frame. This is an example of the occurrence of relative velocity between light and observer.
